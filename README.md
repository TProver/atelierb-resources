This is an open-source repository of resources for [Atelier B](https://www.atelierb.eu/en/atelier-b-support-maintenance/download-atelier-b/), covering both software development with B and the B method, and system modelling with Event-B.
This online document contains a number of useful resources to operate the Atelier B formal tool to model, verify by proof, and to generate C source code.\
It is organized in 7 parts:

* [Resources for Atelier B](docs/paradigms.md): presentation 
* [Getting your hands dirty](broken-reference): practical/technical information linked to the use of Atelier B
* [Using B](broken-reference): some chapters extracted from the "B Language User Manual"
* [B examples](broken-reference): a collection of software models, from specification to implementation, down to source code in many cases
* [Event-B examples](broken-reference): a collection of system-level models
* [Glossary](glossary.md): a list of frequent specific words and expressions, and their meaning
* [References](references.md): several useful links

## The B Files

The [B code files]() are listed here:

# Running the Code

There is a collection of source code files, duplicating the code in the book. 

* You will need the latest [Atelier B Community Edition](https://www.atelierb.eu/en/atelier-b-support-maintenance/download-atelier-b/). Examples have designed with Atelier B 4.7.1 (and later): results are not guaranteed if an older version is used instead.
