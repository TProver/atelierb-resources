# Running the Code

There is a collection of source code files, duplicating the code in the book. 

* You will need the latest [Atelier B Community Edition](https://www.atelierb.eu/en/atelier-b-support-maintenance/download-atelier-b/). Examples have designed with Atelier B 4.7.1 (and later): results are not guaranteed if an older version is used instead.
